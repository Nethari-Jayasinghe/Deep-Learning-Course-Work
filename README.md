# Deep-Learning-Course-Work

Task(s) – content
You are required to use any two deep learning architectures (under supervised, unsupervised, 
generative/semi-supervised or reinforcement learning) to solve any real-world problem. The 
respective deep neural based models can be accessed via https://huggingface.co/models or 
you may implement from scratch if you wish. You must use the Yelp Reviews dataset 
https://www.yelp.com/dataset as per the corpus requirement.
The implemented deep neural models should be compared based on the evaluation 
results. 
You may form a group of minimum three to maximum four members. (As an example, the 
groups which had been formed for the Data Science Group Project can be used for this 
purpose as per your wish)

Task(s) – format
Considering the nature and the purpose of the dataset, the selection of the models can be 
varied. The optimal model selection, implementation and evaluation will be considered. The 
code must be governed through Git. A report should be prepared including the proposing 
solution methodology, experimental results, evaluation criteria, any limitations, and 
possible future enhancements. The project Git URL should be publicly accessible and 
should be mentioned in the report.
